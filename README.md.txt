# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning (VGG19)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects Pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a
deep learning model based on transfer learning with VGG19.

## 🧠 Model Used
- VGG19 (pretrained on ImageNet)
- Fine-tuned on chest X-ray dataset

## 📂 Dataset
- Chest X-ray images
- Classes: NORMAL, PNEUMONIA

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook Pneumonia_Detection_VGG19.ipynb
4. Run all cells

## 📊 Results
- Test Accuracy: ~90%
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report included

## 📌 Note
